This endpoint is configured to receive data in JSON format, sent through an HTTP POST request. 
The data transmitted will then be stored in the database and added to the list of all reviews. 
The framework even generates an interactive web form, 
that lets us directly interact with the endpoint using our browser, which can be really handy for testing and debugging.

To complete this module, you'll write a script that interacts with a running web service.  
The web service is part of your company's website and is in charge of storing and displaying the customer reviews of the company.
The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, 
process the information to turn it into the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored.

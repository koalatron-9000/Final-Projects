This endpoint is configured to receive data in JSON format, sent through an HTTP POST request. 
The data transmitted will then be stored in the database and added to the list of all reviews. 
The framework even generates an interactive web form, 
that lets us directly interact with the endpoint using our browser, which can be really handy for testing and debugging.

To complete this module, you'll write a script that interacts with a running web service.  
The web service is part of your company's website and is in charge of storing and displaying the customer reviews of the company.
The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, 
process the information to turn it into the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored.

What youâ€™ll do:
Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files
Manage information stored in Python dictionaries
Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service
Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods

Requirements:
OS library
Requests library
JSON library
(can I replace OS with Glob?)
script name:"run.py"

I need to import all .txt files and map them to dictionaries.
from there i'll encode them with JSON
the use PUT from requests to send the data to the website.
